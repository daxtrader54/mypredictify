## Model Notes

Predictions use a 3-model blend: 30% Elo Ratings + 30% Poisson Model + 40% Bookmaker Odds. Expected goals are calculated using Dixon-Coles methodology from actual home/away goals scored and conceded per game.

**Constraints Applied:**
- No outcome probability below 3%
- Probabilities normalized to sum to 100%
- Confidence = highest outcome probability (capped at 95%)

**Known Limitations:**
- Elo ratings are seeded estimates, not yet calibrated from results
- Squad news and injuries are not factored into predictions
- Predicted scores are the Poisson mode (single most likely scoreline), not expected scores
