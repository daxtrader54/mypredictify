## Form Analysis Instructions

Analyze the last 5-10 matches for each team. Consider:

### Metrics to Calculate
- Points per game (last 5 and last 10)
- Goals scored/conceded per game (home and away separately)
- Win/Draw/Loss distribution
- Current streak (winning/losing/drawing/unbeaten)
- Quality-adjusted form (weight results by opponent strength)

### Patterns to Identify
- Is the team improving, stable, or declining?
- Are they scoring consistently or in bursts?
- Do they concede early or late goals?
- Home fortress or away weakness?
- Big game performance vs weaker teams

### Output Format
Produce a form rating 0-100 for each team:
- 80-100: Exceptional form (5+ game winning streak, dominant performances)
- 60-80: Good form (winning more than losing, consistent)
- 40-60: Average form (mixed results, no clear trend)
- 20-40: Poor form (losing more than winning, struggling)
- 0-20: Crisis form (long losing streak, confidence crisis)

Also note the **trend**: improving / stable / declining
And the **homeAdvantage** adjustment: -1.0 to +1.0 scale
